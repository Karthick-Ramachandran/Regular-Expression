# Regular-Expression
Simple form validation using regular expression


I know it is very hard to learn Regular expressions in Javascript, usually it takes upto a month to finish Regular expressions.
Though it is not compulsory to study Regular expressions but sometimes it is useful in front-end validation.
You can do validations on back-end but it's nice to have front-end validation.
If you don't know regular expressions feel free to use this.
You don't need to do it from scratch, use this to understand RE faster.
